There once was a boy named Peter. Peter went to UW Madison and he loved to program and do math.
It was his first day to UW-Madison, Peter is very nervous as well as excited to make new friends and pursue his passion of becoming a 
computer scientist. In his first semester, he took a good number of programming and math courses.
